# Real Estate Assignment
A Flutter application to showcase Real Estate.

## **Assignment Overview**
In this assignment, I mainly focused on good Project architecture (that helps in project scalability and easy maintenance), state management, modularity, naming convention and optimizations etc.

For developing the Real Estate App, below main packages are used:
#### **Architecture**:
*MVVM*

#### **State Management**:
*MobX with get_it*

#### **Routing**:
*go_router*

#### **SVG Icons**:
*flutter_svg*

#### **Grid View**:
*flutter_staggered_grid_view*

#### **Google Map**:
*google_maps_flutter*

## Note

*Key pointers that are taken care of in this assignment:*

*1. MVVM Architecture*

*2. MobX State Management*

*3. Coding Standard*

*4. Modular*

*5. Scalable*

*6. Maintainable*

It would be very great if you could share the feedback on it. Does not matter if it is **positive** or **negative** but it will help me to improve myself as I have given a good amount of time to complete this assignment.

Due to not having a proper design tool(Figma, others), I tried to extract information from the given video and screenshots and tried to make it as similar as possible. The animation shown is not 100% the same but I tried to match that level as well with a limited time period as I am working as a lead and have high priority on current product delivery.

Kindly review and share your feedback.
